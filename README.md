## Contributing

### Developer's Certificate of Origin

When submitting changes to the libseccomp artwork you need to provide a
sign-off for your work.  The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the patch
description, which certifies that the work is your own or you otherwise have
the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.  The "Developer's Certificate
of Origin" pledge is taken from the Linux Kernel and the rules are pretty
simple:

	Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

	By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

	(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
	    have the right to submit it under the open source license
	    indicated in the file; or

	(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
	    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
	    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
	    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
	    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
	    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
	    in the file; or

	(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
	    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
	    it.

	(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
	    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
	    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
	    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
	    this project or the open source license(s) involved.

... then you just add a line to the bottom of your patch description, with
your real name, saying:

	Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
